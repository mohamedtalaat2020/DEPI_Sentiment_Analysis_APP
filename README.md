# ML DEPI Streamlit Sentiment Analysis APP 😊😐😔😡

<br>

## About
**A sentiment analysis application built using Streamlit( An open source framework to build web applications in python )**

Sentiment Analysis is one of the most famous applications of Natural Language Processing. Wherever data is present, we can apply it. The objective of the project is to create a web application which will harbor all sorts of applications in the field of sentiment analysis from EDA to Model Deployment.
